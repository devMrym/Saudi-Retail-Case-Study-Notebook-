## 📦 The Shipping Crisis (Saudi Retail Case Study)
### 📋 Project Overview

This project investigates shipment delays for a major Saudi-based e-commerce platform. Management has noticed a significant decline in customer satisfaction, with many packages not reaching customers on time.

The goal is to identify the root cause of shipment delays—whether it’s a logistics issue (Mode of Shipment), a product factor (Weight/Cost), or a strategy problem (Discounts/Priority)—and provide actionable solutions to improve delivery performance and customer satisfaction.

### 🎯 Management's Question

"We are losing money and customers. We need to know: Is this a logistics problem (Mode of Shipment), a product problem (Weight/Cost), or a strategy problem (Discounts/Priority)? Find the root cause and build a system to save our customers."
